            <p>As a series, Madness Combat's calling card is its excessive and brutal violence. While early episodes featured general mass violence, elements of horror and science fiction have slowly become more apparent as the series has evolved.

The series chiefly focuses around the main protagonist, Hank J. Wimbleton, and his endeavors of killing his foes. It is established in the second episode that the episodes are set "Somewhere in Nevada."
Hank J. Wimbleton is the main protagonist of the series. He is allies with Sanford, Deimos and 2BDamned. His main foes include the Sheriff, Jesus, Tricky the Clown, the Auditor, and other units within the Agency Against Hank Wimbleton. In Madness Combat 1 and Madness Redeemer, he looks like an ordinary Madness character, but this changes throughout the series, and he eventually gains his trademark black coat and red sunglasses in later episodes.

Dr. Jebadiah Christoff was the first antagonist of the series until Madness Combat 6: Antipathy. He first appeared in Madness Combat 1 alongside Hank. In the early episodes, he works for the Sheriff, but following his death in Madness Combat 3: Avenger he seems to be independent.

Jeb possesses many supernatural abilities, including levitation, the ability to ward off bullets, and the power to resurrect people from the dead as zeds. He was also Hank's most dangerous opponent, having killed him four out of the nine times Hank has died. In his cameo appearance in Antipathy, he has apparently given up violence and was shown passively raking leaves. To date, Jeb has died five times. The opening sequence of Madness Depredation nicknames him "The Savior".

Tricky The Clown<img class="sFlh5c FyHeAf iPVvYb" src="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.4812465181.2939/bg,f8f8f8-flat,750x,075,f-pad,750x1000,f8f8f8.jpg">
Tricky has abnormal and superhuman abilities, but only since the events of Madness Depredation. His face paint starts white, but his face turns green when he is resurrected Tricky is a wild card; neither the protagonist nor antagonist, he appears to dislike everyone except for the 1337 Crew and other minor characters. First appearing in Madness Redeemer, Tricky has been featured in almost every Madness Combat animation and short since. Initially a standard character of seemingly little importance, Tricky, over the course of the series, became Hank's most powerful foe. But Hank keeps trying to kill tricky no matter how many times he dies.

Auditor<img class="sFlh5c FyHeAf iPVvYb" src="https://preview.redd.it/auditor-from-memory-v0-3n0xdhifg2md1.png?auto=webp&s=e773108df57fa81e58d1d03a74d207ba1bc6d4ff">
The Auditor is the main antagonist of the Madness Combat series, first debuting in Madness Combat 7: Consternation and the master of the Improbability Drives.
The Auditor is also the shadowy figure behind the creation of the A.A.H.W., a covert army founded specifically to kill Hank J. Wimbleton and his allies Sanford and Deimos, who he sees as threats to reality itself because of their endless killing sprees.

Sanford<img class="sFlh5c FyHeAf iPVvYb" src="https://carboncostume.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanford-Madness-Combat-character.png">
Sanford is the deuteragonist of the Madness Combat series, primarily fighting alongside Deimos. He wears a bandana, black teashades, army-camo pants and has a double helix pattern tattoo on his back.

Deimos<img class="sFlh5c FyHeAf" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRohdRJRy26ZDCPlAinyeN7knwBUHtfIfjFvw&s">
Deimos is the tritagonist of the Madness Combat series who usually appears alongside Sanford. He has a bandaged head, wears a headset and visor, and has been seen wearing a vest with a white tank top underneath.

2BDamned
"Doc", or common alias "2BDamned", is the tetratagonist of the Madness Combat series. He helps Deimos escape from Purgatory in the events of DedmosRebuilt.fla and he helped Hank escape in Madness combat 9.5.</p>

    <h1>Story</h1>
<p>In this episode, Madness Combat's protagonist, Hank J. Wimbleton, And his antagonist, Jesus, debuts.

The animation begins with Hank standing around a tree and a man with a boombox, Playing a version of the Chicken Dance, and a dancing grunt in the background. Hank, goes up to the owner of the boombox to go to grab the boombox but the owner punches him causing him to fall to the ground; Hank becomes angry and beats the boombox man to death. A riot then starts among the other characters in which everyone tries to kill Hank, except the dancing man in the background, who seems oblivious to the violence. Hank manages to kill multiple people, and makes sure they're dead by blowing up their bodies with a frag grenade. 
After the grenade explodes, Jesus Christ, who distinguishes himself from the rest of the characters with his goatee, long hair and halo, takes on Hank. He turns two of the corpses into zombies with a lightning bolt, which upon contact, not only revives people but also turns their bare skin into a transparent green and make them stronger and more resistant. 
They give another try at attacking Hank, but then get killed again. When Hank tries to shoot Jesus with a MAC-10, Jesus defends himself by quickly summoning a cross-shaped shield. Jesus then shoots hank with a lightning bolt, knocking him down, and repeatedly body slamming him into the ground. 
When Jesus realizes his zombies do not offer enough offensive power, he pushes the bodies away, then decides to summon a cannon and fires a few shots at Hank, which he dodges by ducking and jumping. While trying to shoot hank, Jesus is then caught off guard and then shot by Hank's MAC-10. Several more people begin charging at Hank, who now uses PPKs, knives and a sawed-off shotgun to take them out. After killing all his foes, Hank brings the boombox to him and shoots the dancing man in the background. 


Madness Combat 2: Redeemer
Hank initiates his next massacre by strangling the very first, unsuspecting guardsman with a fiber wire. Through stealth-aimed movement he makes his way to a building's roof, covered with more unaware guards to kill. As Hank advances he guides himself to his goal with a "Sheriff tracker", which appears to be a heartbeat-sensing radar display device for tracking his final victim, the Sheriff. 
Once he notes the Sheriff is right below him, Hank draws a frag grenade from his pocket and blows a hole into the roof he's standing on for a surprise-attack. The Sheriff, in a sudden rush of panic, flees through the door to his left and fires a shot in Hank's direction while doing so, only to miss him and hit one of his guardsmen. Through swift moves of melee and firearm-violence, Hank finishes off every single retaliating grunt in the room as well as 13 others who enter one by one. Hank advances, armed with a shotgun he took from one of the dead grunts. As Hank passes through the door, Jesus enters unnotedly. 

Jesus immediately enters and prepares to overpower Hank with his supernatural forces. When Hank is about to shoot him, Jesus telepathically pushes him to the other end of the room and then resurrects the departed enemies as zombies, except for Tricky. As Hank massacres the zombies, Jesus leaves the room. After murdering the zombies, as well as more grunts who enter the room, Hank enters the elevator. 
Two grunts jump onto the elevator and try to take out Hank, the second grunt cuts a hole into the roof of the elevator so that the first grunt can fire at Hank. Hank shoots at the grunt, who ends up missing and killing the grunt with the plasma cutter. A third grunt jumps onto the elevator, and throws in a frag grenade, only for the grenade to be returned to the grunts, which kills them. Two more grunts jump onto and into the elevator as well, and killed just as easily as the preceding three. Hank jumps onto the roof of the elevator to avoid the gunfire from several grunts outside of the elevator. They then enter the elevator and Hank kills one of the grunts inside and then shoots the cables, killing those inside the elevator. Hank then climbs the broken cable and making his way through multiple rooms on a higher floor, Hank slays every grunt to stand in his way. Instead of murdering the last one, Hank disarms and interrogates him to find the Sheriff before knocking him out. 





Hank advances, dispatches more guards, and picks up two PPK handguns in the process before advancing to the Sheriff's office. As soon as Hank leaves the room, Jesus enters with a Desert Eagle.




Now Hank enters a final room, where the Sheriff is situated with two armed bodyguards. As soon as the door opens, the Sheriff covers behind the desk and Hank quickly shoots the bodyguards. The Sheriff, wielding a PPK, attempts to shoot Hank in a surprise attack, but Hank disarms him by shooting his weapon. 
Hank pins the frightened Sheriff against the wall. While Hank is pointing his dual PPKs at the Sheriff, Jesus appears from behind and shoots Hank in the head with a Desert Eagle.
Moral: Don't try to shoot the sheriff. 


Some MC3
The scene fades in to a couple of armed guards outside a building. One of the guards, who is smoking a cigarette, heads inside; as he walks inside the building, Hank drops down from a vent behind him and stabs him with two knives. Another grunt walks into the room and is quickly taken out by Hank throwing a knife at his head. The second guard from outside comes in and receives a thrown knife to his stomach. Hank then proceeds to pick up the guard's rifle and his two knives before entering the next room. After stabbing the grunt near the entrance, he throws his knives at the other two men in the room. 
More grunts enter the room, but Hank takes them down with his rifle. Another grunt takes cover behind a table, but Hank jumps on the table to both kill him and get a height advantage over the grunts entering the room from where Hank entered. He shoots most of them down before running out of ammunition, finishing the last member of the group by throwing his empty rifle at them. He jumps down from the table and picks up his knives to kill the next wave of grunts who enter the room; afterwards, he picks up an axe and continues onward. 
n the next room, Hank kills a few grunts with his axe before throwing it at a grunt that came from around a corner. Using a knife and a baton, he executes everyone that enters the room before noticing a camera on the wall. The camera is connected to a machine being observed by the Sheriff, with Jesus standing nearby. Clearly unnerved by Hank's swift progress, the Sheriff flips a panel on the machine and presses a button labeled "Improbability Drive". 
The effects of this are obvious as a grunt attacks Hank from behind; when punched, the grunt flies across the room and bounces off the wall. The next couple of grunts fly into the room uncontrollably as Hank knocks them out; one ends up getting his head embedded in the ceiling. The room begins to get cut in half as Hank kills a couple more grunts; after one half falls into a dark abyss, Tricky appears with a jetpack and a M60. He fires at Hank, but the protagonist uses a grunt as a meat shield until Tricky runs out of ammo. The clown flies up and off screen, giving Hank time to grab a new gun and ready himself for the next attack; however, Tricky simply flies around the room to pop out of the door behind Hank, knocking him into the abyss. As Hank falls, a subliminal message appears: "Don't Blink". This message doesn't show anything important. 
Hank falls into a street in front of a building labelled The Bakery!, where he is ambushed by several armed grunts. He takes them (and their backup) out with an acquired SMG as the background begins to change; a faced sun comes up and falling marshmallows and whales can be seen in the background. Hank then dodges a giant marshmallow and takes a street sign to kill a few more grunts. The sun proceeds to sprout a body and attack Hank; Hank swiftly kills it, darkening the sky in the process. 
After killing another yet another grunt, Hank is confronted by Tricky, now wielding a scimitar - he's swiftly killed by Hank impaling him onto the marshmallow with the street sign. Hank picks up a knife and walks away: unbeknownst to him, lightning emits around Tricky's body to revive him as a zombie who removes the streetsign to both free himself and use as a weapon. 
Hank stumbles upon another group of men led by a grunt wearing sunglasses; once again, he kills them all. As Hank slaughters several more incoming enemies, walls drop around him until he is enclosed in a room. After taking out the last of the grunts (by shooting him in the head until he floods a decent portion of the room with blood), Hank sees Tricky descending from above with his jetpack. When his shots have no effect. Tricky tries to strike Hank with the street sign - Hank pulls it out of his hands, knocks him back and shoots at him with a gun lying in the blood. With the clown finally dealt with, Hank ponders on how to get out of the room, only to be distracted when Jebus drops down behind him and turns some of the corpses into zombies. Hank picks up an axe and kills the zombies, finishing off the last one with several shots from his Desert Eagle.
After shooting the last zombie, Hank prepares to confront Jebus; seconds later, the Savior knocks him through the wall. After getting up, he kills a grunt next to a vending machine. More grunts enter the room, one of which throws a knife at Hank; Hank promptly catches it and throws it into the other grunt. The first grunt grabs Hank's discarded Desert Eagle and attempts to fire, only to find out it's empty before Hank tosses him towards the vending machine and kills him by throwing the gun at him. Jebus swoops in through the hole and turns two of the three corpses into zombies. Hank picks up a Tec-9 to kill the zombies and shoot Jebus, who teleports away. With the Savior out of the way for the moment, Hank then goes into the next room, where he finally finds the Sheriff next to the Improbability Drive console.
As the Sheriff retreats into the next room, Hank shoots the grunts in the room and the ones who enter afterward. Now wielding a shotgun, Hank enters the next room and kills the last two bodyguards protecting the Sheriff, but just as he was about to shoot the Sheriff, Jebus impales him from behind with a sword. Despite the mortal wound, Hank still has the strength to flip his shotgun around and shoot Jebus in the head before thrusting the impaled sword into the Sheriff and shooting him in turn. With his mission finally accomplished, Hank then drops dead, ending the animation.
