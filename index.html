            <p>Madness Combat is an animated Flash series created by Krinkels.

The series centers on Hank J. Wimbleton: a man tasked to wipe out an agency specifically tasked to kill him. Despite being killed several times, he is constantly revived and continues his mission to wipe out the agency.

It is distinguished by its unique style of animation; every character in the series is drawn simplistically, the primary color is gray, and facial features are replaced by a cross on each character's face. This is a common technique used in portraiture. Usually it is only used for sketching out the design, however, and not left in the final piece. Leaving these lines in is a unique part of the Madness Combat series.
The series' other distinguishing trait is its violence. People are killed in many different ways over the course of the series, and are often brought back as zombies by Jebus. In addition, Hank is killed at the end of every animation (with the exception of Madness Combat, Madness Antipathy (Hank dies and is revived by Tricky about two-thirds into the episode), and Madness Inundation (where he remains dead from Madness Consternation).</p>
